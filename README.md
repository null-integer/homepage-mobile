## Key Features

* Lightweight
* One file
* Ready for mobile use

## How To Use

Since viewing HTML files in mobile browsers is difficult, I boiled down my Homepage files to one. There are a few features missing, so I might add them later.

I recommend downloading the file, changing your bookmark data on desktop and then transfering it to your mobile.
